This project focuses on the development of a content-based recommendation system for movies, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system suggests movies based on the content present in each film. Key Components:

Textual Data Processing: Utilized NLP techniques, particularly the Count Vectorizer, to convert textual movie descriptions and features into numerical vectors. Applied advanced text processing methods to enhance the quality of the feature vectors.
Cosine Similarity Metric: Implemented the cosine similarity metric to measure the similarity between the content vectors of different movies. This similarity score serves as a crucial factor in determining the relevance of movies to a user's preferences.
Ordering Recommendations: The recommendation system orders the list of suggested movies based on their similarity scores. This approach ensures that the most relevant and similar movies are presented first, enhancing the overall user experience.
User Interface with Streamlit: Integrated Streamlit for the development of a user-friendly interface. Users can easily interact with the system, receiving personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences. By combining machine learning, NLP, and a user-centric design using Streamlit, this movie recommendation system provides a seamless and enjoyable experience for users seeking personalized movie suggestions.
